# Filtering
You can filter the events in `calendar` and `view`.
There could be many cases to use filter, I make it as callback function. Sorry for all non-developers. But it's not so difficult.
The basic concept is here.
```js
filter: (event) => {
  IF THIS EVENT SHOULD BE INCLUDED, return true
  IF NOT, return false
}
```

By Example
```js
filter: (event) => {
  if (event.isFullday == true) {
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```
This code says **If this event is fullday event, use it. But if not so, drop it from event list**. When you need only `fullday` events, this could be useful.

# Sorting
You can also use sorting in `view`. (`calendar` doesn't support sorting, because to display sorted events depends on each view.)
Concept is similar.
```js
sort: (eventA, eventB) => {
  IF eventA SHOULD BE PRIOR TO eventB, return NEGATIVE VALUE 
  IF NOT, return POSITIVE VALUE
}
```

By Example;
```js
sort: (a, b) => {
  return a.duration - b.duration
}
```
This code says, **If duration of event A is smaller than that of event B, event A is prior to event B - sort by smaller duration**

Example 2;
```js
sort: (a, b) => {
  if (a.calendarSeq == b.calendarSeq) {
    return a.startDate - b.startDate
  } else {
    return a.calendarSeq - b.calendarSeq
  }
}
```
This means **Sort by calendar Sequence first. when sequence of two events are same, compare startDate and earlier is prior**.


# Transforming
You can also use transforming in `view`. (`calendar` doesn't support transforming, because to display transformed events depends on each view.)

Concept;
```js
transform: (event)=>{
  IF THIS event NEED some property TO BE CHANGED,
  CHANGE THAT property
  THEN, return event
}

```

By Example;
```js
transform: (event)=>{
  if (event.title.search("Birthday") > -1) { // If the event might include "Birthday" in its title,
    event.icon = "fxemoji-birthdaycake" // Set icon of that event to "fxemoji-birthdaycake"
  }
  return event // Return that event.
}
```

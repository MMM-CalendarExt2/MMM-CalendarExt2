## With `MMM-TelegramBot`
You can command to change scene via `MMM-TelegramBot`
- `/scene` : change to first scene of `scenes` list.
- `/scene n` : change to next scene
- `/scene p` : change to previous scene
- `/scene [number]` : change to nth scene
- `/scene [name]`: change to scene which has `name`

## With `notification`
Other MM module can order to change scene with notification.

### Predefined notifications
**CALEXT2_SCENE_NEXT**
- `.sendNotification("CALEXT2_SCENE_NEXT", null)`

**CALEXT2_SCENE_PREVIOUS**
- `.sendNotification("CALEXT2_SCENE_PREVIOUS", null)`

**CALEXT2_SCENE_CHANGE**
- `.sendNotification("CALEXT2_SCENE_CHANGE", {type:"id", key:0})`
- `.sendNotification("CALEXT2_SCENE_CHANGE", {type:"name", key:"DEFAULT"})`
  - `type` could be `"name"` or `"id"`
  - `key` should be `id(order in scenes)` or `name` of SCENE

### Get events
You can get events by calling this notification for other modules job.
**CALEXT_EVENT_QUERY**
Usage example:
```js
var filterFn = (event) => {
  if (event.startDate > Date.now()) return true
}
var callbackFn = (events) => {
  this.doMyJob(events)
}
this.sendNotification("CALEXT2_EVENT_QUERY", {filter:filterFn, callback:callbackFn})
```
You can filter events by `filterFn`. And you can do your job with filtered events by `callbackFn`
- `filter` and `callback` should be **Function**

### User-defined notification trigger
You can add your custom notification trigger to control this module.

By example, if you want to sync scene to the page of `MMM-Page-Selector`, Scenes need to be changed by `PAGE_CHANGED` notification from `MMM-Page-Selector`.

```js
notifications: {
  "PAGE_CHANGED" : {
    exec: "changeSceneById",
    payload: (payload) => {return payload}
  }
},
```
By this configuration, `PAGE_CHANGED` notification could activate `changeSceneById` method of this module.
- `exec` :  As this value, you can set `string` or `function`.
  - string : member function name of this module (Only below functions are available).
  - callback function: Or you can describe callback function which would return function name.
```js
exec: "FUNCTION NAME",

or

exec: (payload, sender) => {
  ...
  return "FUNCTION NAME"
},
```
- `payload` :  As this value, you can set `null` or `function`.
  - null : When there is no need to use payload.
  - callback function: Or you can describe callback function which would manipulate and convert payload.
```js
payload: null,

or

payload: (payload, sender) => {
  ...
  return CONVERTED_PAYLOAD
},
```

**Available executable functions**
- `sceneNext()`
- `scenePrevious()`
- `changeSceneById(seq)`
- `chageSceneByName(name)`
- `eventQuery({filter:fn(event), callback:fn(events)})`

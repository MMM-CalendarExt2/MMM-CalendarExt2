## CSS
Sorry. CSS of this module is not simple. But, you'd better to look inside `MMM-CalendarExt2.css` if you have an interest.
> You SHOULD NOT modify `MMM-CalendarExt2.css` directly. Use `css/custom.css` for overwriting or adding your CSS rules.

Here are a few simple CSS styling for this module.

### custom class for Event
```css
.CX2 .holiday {
  background-color:#333;
  color:#F00;
}

.CX2 .holiday.fullday {
  background-color:#F00;
  color:#FFF;
}
```
If you set `className` of calendar to `holiday`, this CSS rules will be applied to events of that calendar.

You can control more with this calendar-specific className. By example you can show eventLocation of specific calendar like this;
```css
.CX2 .holiday .eventLocation {
  display:block;
}
```

### some default sizes
```css
.CX2 { /* default values which are used frequently or dependently */
  --row-min-width: 100px;
  --row-max-width: 300px;
  --column-min-width: 300px;

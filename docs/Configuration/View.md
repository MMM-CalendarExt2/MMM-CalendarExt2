# VIEW
- **View** is a specific look and definition to display events. Each view could have several calendars which are defined in `calendars` section. And each view instance can be reusable in multi-scenes.
- There are several view modes; `upcoming`, `current`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `week`, `month`.
- `views:[]` should have at least one or more `view` as its items.

```js
views: [
  {
    name: "Upcoming Hotspurs",
    mode: "upcoming",
    position: "top_right",
    calendars: ["Hotspurs calendar"],
  },
  {
    name: "My family affairs",
    mode: "month",
    position: "bottom_bar",
    calendars: ["holidays", "ScheduleOfWife", "KID SCHOOL PLAN"],
  },
],
```
This example shows 2 views.
- **Upcoming Hotspurs** is `upcoming` view and will be displayed in `top_right` with "Hotspurs calendar".
- **My family affairs** is `month` view and will be displayed in `bottom_bar` with 3 calendars. (calendars should be already defined in [calendars section](Calendar.md) of configuration)

Your Scene could have those as its views.

## Detailed configuration
Each view can be configured with many properties. (Yes, Too many. :D)

### Common
These fields could be used in all views. (But some fields might work differently in views)

|field |value type |value example |default value |memo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|name |String | "My weekly schedule" | - |**NOT REQUIRED BUT RECOMMENDED**<br/> You can specify specific view with this name. It will be used in `scene`.
|mode | String |"month" |"daily" | `"upcoming"`, `"current"`, `"daily"`, `"weekly"`, `"monthly"`, `"week"`, `"month"` are available.
|className |String | "myViewClass" | "" | You can adjust CSS class to this view.
|position |String | "bottom_bar" | "top_left" | Where to display this view.
|positionOrder |Integer |2 | -1 | view order in position region. `-1`: last of region, `0`: first of region, Any positive integer like `2`: `n`th in region
|calendars |Array of calendar names | ["My Football calendar", "US Holidays"] | [] | Which calendar events will be shown in this view. For all calendars, just set to `[]`
|title |String or callback | "SCHEDULE" | "" | It will be used as module header title.
|locale |String | "de-DE" | default locale | You can apply specific locale to only this view instead default locale.
|fromNow |Integer | -1 | 0 | When this view calendar will be start. <br> By example; in `view:monthly`, `-1` will be last month, `0` will be this month, `1` will be next month.<br/><br/>In view of `upcoming`, `current`, this value will be ignored.
|slotCount |Integer |4 | 3 | How many periodic calendar slot will be shown. <br> By example; in `view:monthly`, `3` will show 3 `monthly` view slot. <br><br/>`mode:daily`, `fromNow:-1`, `slotCount:3` will be show three daily calendar slots from yesterday to tomorrow
|hideOverflow |Boolean |false | true | If events in slot are too many, you can hide some of events by this. Use with `slotMaxHeight`
|hideFooter |Boolean |false | true | If you want to hide the footer bar (e.g. week view, where it shows week number and count of overflowing items), set this to true
|slotMaxHeight |String | "200px" | "150px" | Set your slot height to display events. It is affected when you set `hideOverflow`. If you want the height of the calendar to be adjusted automatically to the height needed (e.g. in week view), set this value to "auto".
|slotTitle | String | "My Upcoming Schedule" | - | Set slot title with static text. This is prior than `slotTitleFormat`. If you want to display dynamic slot title by date, leave this to null or empty(`""`). <br/>**RECOMMENDED** only to `view:current` and `view:upcoming`.
|slotTitleFormat | String Or Object | "MM/DD" | - | Set slot title by date. formatter of `.format()` of `moment.js` or object of `.calendar()` of `moment.js`
|slotSpaceRight | Integer | 3 | 0 | How much space should be left on the right side of entries in week or month view
|slotSubTitle | String | "" | - | subtitle of slot. See `slotTitle` also.
|slotSubTitleFormat | String Or Object | "" | - | subtitle format of slot. See `slotTitleFormat` also.
|filterPassedEvent |Boolean | true | false | If event is passed, filter it.
|maxItems |Integer | 30 | 100 | How many items will be targeted for this view.
|skipItems |Integer | 30 | - | How many items should be skipt (e.g. cause they allready displays in another column).
|dateFormat|Object | {...} | {...} | See [Event Time](../Event-Time.md).
|timeFormat|Object | {...} | {...} | See [Event Time](../Event-Time.md).
|dateTimeFormat|Object | {...} | {...} | See [Event Time](../Event-Time.md).
|relativeFormat|Object | {...} | {...} | See [Event Time](../Event-Time.md).
|useEventTimeRelative |Boolean |true |false | If true, relativeFormat will be used instead time/date/dateTimeFormat. See [Event Time](../Event-Time.md)|
|filter|Function | (e)=>{} | (e)=>{...} | See [Filtering and Sorting](../Filtering-and-Sorting.md)
|sort|Function | (a,b)=>{} | (a,b)=>{...} | See [Filtering and Sorting](../Filtering-and-Sorting.md)
|transform|Function| (e)=>{} | (e)=>{...} | See [Filtering and Sorting](../Filtering-and-Sorting.md)

#### title callback
If you can set `title` as a callback function, the result of function will be used as module title.
```js
title: (mObj) => {
  return mObj.format("[My Weekly:] Wo")
},
```
This example will return "My Weekly: 49th" or similar.

callback function get `moment Object` of first slot start time for arguments. So you can handle it in callback function.

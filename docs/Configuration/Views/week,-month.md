You can use all of common fields of [View](../View.md) in these views also.

`view:week` and `view:month` could be too wide and tall for small screen. Use it carefully.

If you set these view positions as `fullscreen_below` or `fullscreen_above`, these views will be fixed in bottom. You can adjust position with CSS

# View:week
|field |value type |value example |default value |memo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|slotTitleFormat |String |"M/D" |"D" |date of calendar cell
|slotSubTitleFormat |String |"dddd" |"ddd" |weekday of calendar cell
|slotAltTitleFormat |String |"MMM D|"M/D" |Only for view:week and view:month. <br>Alternative slot title when it is needed.(e.g: month changed, start of calendar...)
|showWeekends |Boolean |false |true |Show Saturday and Sunday.
|slotMaxHeight |String |"150px" |"240px" |height of calendar cell. `hideOverflow` is set to `true` by force in this view.
|weeksFormat |String |"[week] wo" |"wo" |Weeks mark of calendar.
|monthFormat |String | "[Month:] MM" | "MMMM" |The title of month in current view. (CSS selector:`.monthViewTitle`)

# View:month
|field |value type |value example |default value |memo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|slotTitleFormat |String |"M/D" |"D" |date of calendar cell
|slotSubTitleFormat |String |"dddd" |"ddd" |weekday of calendar cell
|slotAltTitleFormat |String |"MMM D|"M/D" |Only for view:week and view:month. <br>Alternative slot title when it is needed.(e.g: month changed, start of calendar...)
|showWeekends |Boolean |false |true |Show Saturday and Sunday.
|slotMaxHeight |String |"120px" |"150px" |height of calendar cell. `hideOverflow` is set to `true` by force in this view.
|weeksFormat |String |"[week] wo" |"wo" |Weeks mark of calendar.
- In `view:month`, `slotCount` will be ignored.

## Examples
- Basic Sample
```js
{
  name: "VIEW1",
  mode: "week",
  position: "fullscreen_below",
  title: "My Schedule",
},
```
![view7](view7.png)
- modification Sample.
```js
{
  name: "VIEW1",
  mode: "week",
  position: "fullscreen_below",
  title: "My Schedule",
  fromNow: -1,
  slotCount: 4,
  slotMaxHeight: "120px",
  showWeekends: false,
},
```
![view8](view8.png)

- another sample.
```js
{
  name: "VIEW1",
  mode: "month",
  position: "bottom_bar",
  title: "My Schedule",
  slotMaxHeight: "70px",
  dateFormat: "M/D",
},
```

- In this example, I changed screen resolution from wide:1920 to wide:1080.(vertical layout). You can see view:month is too narrow in `bottom_bar`. Put it into `fullscreen`.

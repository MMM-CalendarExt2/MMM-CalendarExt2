You can use all of common fields of [View](../View.md) in this view also.

# View:daily
|field |value type |value example |default value |memo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|type |String |"row" |"column" | You can arrange event slots by row or column. This field will be ignored in other views. In `bar` or `fullscreen` region, `"row"` could look nicer.
|slotSubTitleFormat |String |"" |"MMMM Do" |predefined extra information of slots of this daily view.
|slotTitleFormat |String Or Object |"" | {...} |predefined slot title.
- You can use calendar-type humanized format for slot Title in this daily view. (In other views, this will be meaningless). Default values are below;
```js
slotTitleFormat: {
  sameDay: '[Today]',
  nextDay: '[Tomorrow]',
  nextWeek: 'dddd',
  lastDay: '[Yesterday]',
  lastWeek: '[Last] ddd',
  sameElse: 'ddd, M/D'
},
```

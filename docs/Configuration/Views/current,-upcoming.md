You can use all of common fields of [View](../View.md) in these views also.

# View:current
|field |value type |value example |default value |memo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|slotTitle |String |"My current" |"Current" |In view:current and view:upcoming, there is no need of dynamic slot title. You can set fixed slot title with this field.
|maxItems |Integer |5 |10 |How many items shall be shown.
|useEventTimeRelative |Boolean |false |true |Personally, I like relative format in current & upcoming view. You can modify it.

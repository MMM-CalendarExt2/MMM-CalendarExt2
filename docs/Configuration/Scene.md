# SCENE
**Scene** is a set of Calendar **View**s. You can define several scenes for your purpose. MM will display one scene at a time. You can rotate scenes by time or notification.

- Scenes Example : `My Calendar`, `Wife's Calendar`, `Tom's Calendar`
- Another Scenes Example : `Last Month`, `This Month`, `Next Month`, ...


Here is an example of `scenes` fields
```javascript
scenes: [ // `scenes` could have several scenes as elements of array
  {
    name: "My Soccer",
    views: ["Upcoming Hotspurs Games", "Monthly Champion's League Schedule"],
  },
  {
    name: "All",
    views: [],
  },
],
```
In above example, we have 2 scenes - **My Soccer** and **All**.

- **My Soccer** has 2 views - "Upcoming Hotspurs Games", "Monthly Champion's League Schedule".
- **All** has all views([] means all. whichever they are.)

These 2 Scenes will be displayed in turn by time, or be changed by notification.

**SCENE**

|views|Array of `view name`|["Holidays", "Business Meeting"] |[] |To specify views in this scene. If set as `[]`, all views will be included in this scene. |
